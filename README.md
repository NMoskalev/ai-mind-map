## How to Contribute

Feel free to contribute to this project by making changes to the `src/mindmap.mm.md` file, which is rendered via [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/). Markmap is a combination of Markdown and mindmap. It parses Markdown content and extracts its intrinsic hierarchical structure and renders an interactive mindmap, aka markmap.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nmoskalev/ai-mind-map.git
   ```

2. Make changes to the `src/mindmap.mm.md` file as needed.

3. Preview your changes using the Markmap rendering by following the [Markmap documentation](https://markmap.js.org/).

4. Export your changes as html

5. Replace content of docs/index.html with your own autogenerated html markup

### Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

If you prefer working in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can use the Markmap extension to render and edit your mind map. Simply install the extension and open the `src/mindmap.mm.md` file in VSCode. You can find the Markmap extension in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode).

Happy contributing!
